devQuest
========

The quest for opensource freedom starts here!

devQuest is a work-in-progress rpg game that will leverage the power of the GitHub api to build a adventure for open source dev around the world.

Currently in pre-alpha, very little has been done yet.  The plan is to make as much of the game from scratch.  that means art, music, storyline, and engine will be hand made.

Feel free to fork and issue pull request for both art and music, but till the storyline is fleshed out, there is no guarenty that either will be used.
